# CarrelTeX Progress Ledger

Allowed status enum: `todo | stubbed | implemented | verified | skipped`.
`verified` means the row's proof command is currently green.

| path | layer | component | status | proof | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/carreltex-core/src/mount.rs` | core | mount-policy | verified | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/carreltex-core/Cargo.toml` | Path policy SSOT via `normalize_path_v0` + `read_file_by_bytes_v0`, resource caps, finalize rules, and byte-level (non-UTF8 allowed) main.tex validation |
| `crates/carreltex-core/src/compile.rs` | core | compile-contract-types-v0 | verified | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/carreltex-core/Cargo.toml` | Compile status/request/result types + canonical report builder/validator + strict TeX stats JSON SSOT (`build_tex_stats_json_v0` + `validate_tex_stats_json_v0`) + status-token/missing-components helper checks + bounded binary event encoding helpers/constants (kind=1 log bytes, kind=2 TeX stats JSON) |
| `crates/carreltex-engine/src/lib.rs` | engine | compile-seam-v0 | verified | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/carreltex-engine/Cargo.toml` | Public engine API remains stable while implementation is modularized into internal submodules; compile behavior now includes tokenizer validation + input expansion v0 + macro expansion v0 (supports `\\def\\foo{body}`, single-parameter `\\def\\foo#1{body}` with strict braced calls `\\foo{arg}`, `\\let` subset `\\let\\a=\\b` / `\\let\\a\\b`, `\\futurelet` subset `\\futurelet\\a\\b\\c` where all three are control sequences and `\\a` aliases control-seq literal `\\c` while leaving `\\b\\c` in stream, `\\expandafter` subset `\\expandafter\\a\\b` that deterministically reorders to `\\b\\a`, `\\csname ... \\endcsname` subset where body is non-empty Char-only bytes that become one ControlSeq token, and `\\string\\foo` subset that emits Char tokens for literal bytes `\\` + `foo`); `\\let` and `\\futurelet` are scope-local like `\\def` while `\\global\\let` and `\\global\\futurelet` write global; `\\def` is group-scoped while `\\gdef`, `\\global\\def`, `\\global\\gdef`, and repeated `\\global` prefixes before `def` or `gdef` write to global scope and can leak across groups; unsupported `\\global` prefix uses fail-closed reason `macro_global_prefix_unsupported`, unsupported `\\let` targets use `macro_let_unsupported`, unsupported `\\futurelet` syntax uses `macro_futurelet_unsupported`, unsupported `\\expandafter` syntax uses `macro_expandafter_unsupported`, unsupported `\\csname` syntax uses `macro_csname_unsupported`, and unsupported `\\string` syntax uses `macro_string_unsupported`; other params/`#` forms are fail-closed before parse-stub group-balance and deterministic token stats JSON (events kind=2), with deterministic bounded compile logs and INVALID_INPUT reason-token precedence A-G (request_invalid → mount_finalize_failed → entrypoint_missing → tokenize_failed → input_* → macro_* → stats_build_failed), including `macro_validation_failed` / `macro_params_unsupported` / `macro_cycle_failed` / `macro_depth_exceeded` / `macro_expansions_exceeded`; successful NOT_IMPLEMENTED logs include `INPUT_TRACE_V0:<json>` only when it fully fits max_log_bytes (otherwise omitted, never truncated), with explicit `main.xdv` artifact seam (empty until engine wired) |
| `crates/carreltex-engine/src/tex/tokenize_v0.rs` | engine | tex-tokenizer-v0 | verified | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/carreltex-engine/Cargo.toml` | Deterministic TeX lexing subset with explicit v0 assumptions (NUL invalid, `^^` blocked, `\\verb` blocked, `%` comments, whitespace coalescing, control words/symbols, token cap fail-closed) |
| `crates/carreltex-wasm-smoke/src/lib.rs` | wasm-adapter | abi-v0 | verified | `./scripts/proof_v0.sh` | Thin ABI adapter over core+engine semantics, strict report/status+missing_components cross-consistency, per-path log bounds + TeX stats JSON invariants with core validator defense-in-depth, deterministic binary events seam carrying kind=1(log bytes)+kind=2(stats JSON), allocator bounded by `MAX_WASM_ALLOC_BYTES_V0` (artifact-aligned), generic artifact-by-name ABI + `main.xdv` copy-out cap enforcement, and mount read-back ABI |
| `scripts/proof_v0.sh` | proof | v0-bundle | verified | `./scripts/proof_v0.sh` | Bundle gate: LOC guard (scans tracked `crates/**/*.rs` + `scripts/**/*.mjs`, hard limit <=1000 lines) + core tests + wasm smoke + ledger check |
| `scripts/wasm_smoke_js_proof.mjs` | proof | wasm-js-smoke | verified | `./scripts/proof_wasm_smoke.sh` | Thin JS proof entrypoint; scenarios are modularized under `scripts/wasm_smoke_js/*.mjs` while preserving proof order/output and ABI compatibility checks including compile-request path |
